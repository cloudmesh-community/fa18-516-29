Hadoop,Hive and Spark cluster set up on Amazon EC2 instances. 

The following section describes how to set up a multi node Hadoop cluster in Amazon EC2 instance.It also describes how to install and set up Spark
and Hive as part of this cluster set up.

1. Configuring EC2 instances in AWS and Setting up passwordless ssh communication bewteen these instances and configuring the Elastic IPs 
   in EC2 instances.

   Motivation: Before setting up a Hadoop cluster,it is important to set up connection between our client machine and the EC2 instances as 
   well as passwordless communication between the EC2 instances.Also,the IP of EC2 instances changes when we restart the servers.Since,we
   will need to stop and restart the machines only when we are using them,it is important to set up elastic ips for these instances,which
   do not change else our passwordless ssh connection set up will not work.
