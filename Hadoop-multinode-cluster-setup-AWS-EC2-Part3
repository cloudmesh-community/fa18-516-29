Hadoop,Hive and Spark cluster set up on Amazon EC2 instances(Part-3):

The following section describes the installation and configuration of hive on Hadoop cluster:


Motivation:
 Hive provides a datawarehousing solution on hadoop and can be used to do computation on data which is of relational format.This has
 a great use case in industries where most of the data are in relational format in legacy systems and are archived in disks.
 When there is a business case to bring such data on a Big Data Platform and do some analytics on them,then Hive comes as the first choice.
 Hive can run on multiple exceution engines and can be integrated with Spark so that the underlying computation engine is Spark and not
 mapreduce.This increas the performance of hive queries by manifold.Tez is another execution engine of choice with Hive.Both have
 an advantage over map reduce that they do the computation of data in memory by creating immutable datasets and do not write
 the intermediate query outputs to the hdfs like mapreduce.This saves lot of Physical I/O and makes the processing much faster.
 
 Installation:
  
  i. Download and Install Hive 2.3 which is compatible with Hadoop 2.9 only in the master machine.
      wget https://www-us.apache.org/dist/hive/hive-2.3.3/apache-hive-2.3.3-bin.tar.gz -P ~/hive_installation
   
  ii.Uncompress the tar file in a directory $HIVE_HOME
      tar zxvf ~/hive_installation/apache-hive-* -C ~/hive_home
      
  iii.Set up the env variables in all the .profile and .bashrc of all the servers
      export HIVE_HOME=/home/ubuntu/hive_home/apache-hive-2.3.3-bin
      export PATH=$PATH:$HIVE_HOME/bin
      export HIVE_CONF_DIR=/home/ubuntu/hive_home/apache-hive-2.3.3-bin/conf
      export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/home/ubuntu/hive_home/apache-hive-2.3.3-bin/lib/*:.
      
   iv.Download and Install derby database for the metadatastore of hive
      wget http://archive.apache.org/dist/db/derby/db-derby-10.4.2.0/db-derby-10.4.2.0-bin.tar.gz
      tar zxvf db-derby-10.4.2.0-bin.tar.gz -C ~/derby_home
      
   v. Set up the env variables for Derby in .bashrc and .profile
      export DERBY_HOME=/home/ubuntu/derby_home/db-derby-10.4.2.0-bin
      export PATH=$PATH:$DERBY_HOME/bin
      export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:$DERBY_HOME/lib/derby.jar:$DERBY_HOME/lib/derbytools.jar
      
   vi. Load profile in all the servers
        ~/.profile
        
   vii. Initialize the schema in derby in $HIVE_HOME folder.This will create a metastore_db directory which is the database
         directory and will be loaded in memory.
         
         cd $HIVE_HOME
         schematool -dbType derby -initSchema
